ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sarthak, a high school student passionate about software development and problem-solving. With over 2 years of experience in Python and a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms through C++, I enjoy crafting efficient and elegant software solutions.

ðŸš€ In my journey as a programmer, I've explored various aspects of programming, from building projects to delving into advanced topics like algorithm implementation and competitive programming. I thrive on challenges and love the process of turning ideas into functional software.

ðŸŒŸ Currently in my 11th grade, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in the field of computer science. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects, participating in coding competitions, or experimenting with new technologies, I'm always eager to expand my skill set and make meaningful contributions to the world of software development.

ðŸ”§ When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest trends in technology, indulging in my love for problem-solving, or working on personal projects that spark my curiosity.
